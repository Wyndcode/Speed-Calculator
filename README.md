Purpose:<br />
For all the sweats of E7 to be able to control their matches more precisely.<br />
By taking a snapshot of the battle on turn 1, even when outsped or slowed, a player can calculate the speeds of all units to show to their guild or to check whether a unit will lap another.<br />
Int less in guild war and maybe arena too. Try doing this in rta if you're fluent enough with the inputs.<br /><br />
Issues:<br />
Not all scenarios are covered. The following are known:<br />
Speed buffed opener (Landy or Siseria in guild wars)<br />
CR pushed opener/units(can just subtract the CR)<br />
Revenge set units and BBK<br /><br />
What is this?:<br />
It is a Java swing GUI desktop application. I hope you can excuse its clunkiness.
